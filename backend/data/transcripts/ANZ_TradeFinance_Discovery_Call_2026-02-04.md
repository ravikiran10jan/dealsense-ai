### Call Recording Transcript

**[00:00:15] Ravi Kiran (DXC Luxoft):**
Good morning everyone, thank you for taking the time to meet with us today. I'm Ravi from DXC Luxoft, and I have Michael Torres, our Solution Architect, joining me. We're excited to discuss how we can support ANZ's trade finance transformation journey.

**[00:00:45] David Chen (ANZ):**
Thanks Ravi. We've been looking at modernizing our trade finance operations for some time now. We've seen some of the work DXC has done with other banks in the APAC region and wanted to explore how you might help us.

**[00:01:20] Ravi Kiran:**
Absolutely, David. Before we dive in, could you give us a quick overview of your current challenges and what you're hoping to achieve?

**[00:01:35] Sarah Mitchell (ANZ):**
Sure. Our main pain points are around manual document processing - we're still heavily reliant on paper-based workflows for letters of credit and guarantees. The processing time is around 3-4 days per transaction, and we're looking to significantly reduce that.

**[00:02:15] James Wong (ANZ):**
We're also interested in AI capabilities for document extraction and validation. We've heard you've been working on some interesting solutions in this space.

**[00:02:45] Ravi Kiran:**
Yes, absolutely. We've implemented similar solutions for several major banks. In fact, we recently completed a large trade finance transformation for Commonwealth Bank of Australia.

**[00:03:10] David Chen (ANZ):**
*That's interesting. What was the size of the trade finance team that implemented at CBA?*

**[00:03:25] Michael Torres (DXC Luxoft):**
For the CBA implementation, we had a dedicated team of 45 specialists. This included 20 developers, 8 business analysts with deep trade finance domain expertise, 6 QA engineers, 5 DevOps engineers, 4 solution architects, and 2 project managers. The implementation was phased over 18 months.

**[00:04:15] Sarah Mitchell (ANZ):**
That's a substantial team. We've also heard you're working with Standard Chartered Bank. *How are you handling data privacy issues for the SCB rollout with the in-house platform?*

**[00:04:45] Ravi Kiran:**
Great question, Sarah. *The rollout so far is only in Singapore.* We chose Singapore as the initial deployment location specifically because of its robust data protection framework under the PDPA. This allows us to validate our data handling processes in a controlled regulatory environment before expanding to other regions. We're working closely with SCB's compliance team to ensure all cross-border data transfer requirements are met for the next phase.

**[00:05:30] James Wong (ANZ):**
That makes sense. Regarding the AI capabilities you mentioned - the document extraction and intelligent processing - *are the AI use cases already in production?*

**[00:05:55] Michael Torres:**
*No, they are currently in POC stage.* We have three AI modules in proof-of-concept: intelligent document classification, automated data extraction from trade documents, and anomaly detection for compliance. The POCs have shown promising results - we're seeing 92% accuracy in document classification and 87% accuracy in data extraction. We expect to move to production pilots in Q2 this year.

**[00:06:45] David Chen (ANZ):**
I appreciate the transparency. Can you tell us a bit more about DXC Luxoft? *When did DXC acquire Luxoft?*

**[00:07:05] Ravi Kiran:**
DXC Technology acquired Luxoft in June 2019 for approximately $2 billion. The acquisition was strategic - it combined DXC's enterprise IT services capabilities with Luxoft's digital engineering expertise and strong presence in financial services.

**[00:07:35] Sarah Mitchell (ANZ):**
*When was Luxoft formed originally?*

**[00:07:45] Ravi Kiran:**
Luxoft was founded in 2000, originally in Moscow, and grew to become one of the leading digital strategy and software engineering firms globally. By the time of the acquisition, Luxoft had over 13,000 employees across 44 offices worldwide, with particularly strong practices in automotive, financial services, and healthcare.

**[00:08:20] James Wong (ANZ):**
*What is the difference between DXC and Luxoft in terms of what they offer?*

**[00:08:35] Michael Torres:**
Great question. DXC Technology focuses primarily on enterprise IT services - infrastructure management, applications modernization, cloud services, and IT outsourcing at scale. Luxoft, now DXC Luxoft, specializes in digital engineering and product development - think custom software development, digital strategy, and industry-specific solutions. When you engage DXC Luxoft for trade finance, you get the best of both: Luxoft's deep domain expertise and engineering excellence in financial services, backed by DXC's global delivery capability and enterprise support infrastructure.

**[00:09:30] David Chen (ANZ):**
That's helpful context. Let's talk about timelines. If we were to proceed, what would a realistic implementation timeline look like for a bank our size?

**[00:09:55] Ravi Kiran:**
Based on our experience with similar implementations, we'd recommend a phased approach over 12-18 months. Phase 1 would focus on Letters of Credit automation - typically 4-5 months. Phase 2 would cover Guarantees and Standby LCs - another 4-5 months. Phase 3 would be the AI/ML capabilities and advanced analytics. We could provide a detailed proposal within two weeks of receiving your requirements documentation.

**[00:10:45] Sarah Mitchell (ANZ):**
What about integration with our existing core banking systems? We're running a mix of legacy and modern systems.

**[00:11:05] Michael Torres:**
We've dealt with similar environments. Our platform uses an API-first architecture with pre-built connectors for major core banking systems. For legacy integrations, we typically use middleware adapters. At SMBC, for instance, we integrated with three different core systems plus their SWIFT infrastructure within the first phase.

**[00:11:45] James Wong (ANZ):**
Can we arrange a technical deep-dive session? I'd like our architecture team to understand the platform better.

**[00:12:00] Ravi Kiran:**
Absolutely. We can arrange that for next week. We'll also bring some demos of the CBA implementation - anonymized of course - to give your team a sense of the user experience and workflows.

**[00:12:30] David Chen (ANZ):**
That would be great. Before we wrap up, can you send us some reference materials? Case studies, technical architecture overview, and perhaps some ROI metrics from your other implementations?

**[00:12:55] Ravi Kiran:**
Of course. I'll send over our trade finance capabilities deck, the CBA case study, SMBC implementation overview, and our standard ROI calculator. I'll also include some information about our AI roadmap for trade finance.

**[00:13:25] Sarah Mitchell (ANZ):**
One last question - what's your typical commercial model? Are we looking at fixed price, T&M, or something else?

**[00:13:40] Ravi Kiran:**
We offer flexible engagement models. Most of our trade finance clients start with a fixed-price discovery phase to define scope and architecture, then move to a hybrid model for implementation - fixed price for core deliverables with T&M for customizations and integrations. We can discuss specifics once we understand your requirements better.

**[00:14:15] David Chen (ANZ):**
Thanks everyone. This has been very informative. Let's reconvene next week for the technical session.

**[00:14:30] Ravi Kiran:**
Thank you David, Sarah, James. We're excited about the opportunity to work with ANZ on this transformation. I'll send the meeting invite for the technical deep-dive and the materials we discussed. Have a great day.
